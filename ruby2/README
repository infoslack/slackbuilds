Ruby 2.0

Ruby is an interpreted scripting language for quick and easy
object-oriented programming.  It has many features to process text
files and to do system management tasks (as in Perl).  It is simple,
straight-forward, and extensible.

Is it safe to install on a system that already has another version
of Ruby.
